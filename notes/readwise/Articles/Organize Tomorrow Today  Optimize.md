## Highlights
- Taking a zero on one of your most important tasks is the equivalent of a professional athlete losing a game by forfeit. Passing altogether on your priorities completely erodes mental toughness. Jason Selk and Tom Bartow
- ‘Busy’ isn’t what gets rewarded long-term in the marketplace. ‘Productive’ is. ... The most successful people don’t get everything done. They get the most important things done.
- The reality is that our habits aren’t so much formed as they are in a constant state of formation.
- The discouragement monster, as we call it, is so dangerous because it saps your willingness to keep trying. You must remember that scoring often comes in spurts.
- Greatness is predicated on consistently doing things others can’t or won’t do. Simply put, success is *not* about being brilliant. It’s about being consistent.
- What *does* enhance self-image? Learning to talk to yourself about what you do well and how you want to improve.
- When we focus on small, incremental improvements instead of perfection, the human spirit takes over, and all things become much more possible.
- Instead of telling yourself you aren’t special enough to get all the things you want in life, start telling yourself ‘I deserve it!’—and then start deserving it by taking action!
- “This is the point where ‘I can do this’ turns into ‘This is harder than I thought,’ or, ‘Is it really going to matter if I miss a day’ To make it through to the third phase, when the habit becomes second nature, you need to be able to win two or three of these important fight-thru battles with your yourself.”
- Take a nice, deep Centering Breath. In for 6. Hold for 2. Out for 7. Ahhhh… A strong mind is a calm mind and there’s no (!) better way to calm down than thru a centering breath like this. Silently say your Identify Statement. Come up with a simple mantra that captures who you aspire to be. A pro athlete’s example they share: “I am more mentally and physically prepared than the competition. I am a dominant Major League pitcher.” Walk thru your Personal Highlight Reel. Quickly replay three things that were awesome over the last 24 hours and see 3 things that WILL be awesome over the next 24. (in ~30 seconds total) Repeat your Identity Statement. Take another nice Centering Breath.
