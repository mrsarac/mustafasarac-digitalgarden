## Highlights
- “Therefore, for the purposes of this book, I’ll generalize outrageously that there are two kinds of writing. One is explanatory writing: writing that transmits existing information or ideas. The other is exploratory writing: writing that enables us to discover what we want to say. Call it Type B. They are equally valid and useful.”
    - Note: "Bu nedenle, bu kitabın amaçları doğrultusunda, iki tür yazı olduğunu çirkin bir şekilde genelleyeceğim. Biri açıklayıcı yazıdır: mevcut bilgileri veya fikirleri ileten yazı. Diğeri keşif yazısıdır: ne söylemek istediğimizi keşfetmemizi sağlayan yazı. Buna B Tipi adını verin. Aynı derecede geçerli ve faydalıdırlar."
- 1. Writing helps us think. 2. Clear writing is clear thinking. 3. You can (and should to truly learn) about any subject. 4. Everyone (not just “writers”) writes. 5. We learn by imitation. 6. Every subject is accessible through clear writing. 7. Every field, subject, domain... has a literature. 8. There are two kinds of writing: explanatory and exploratory. 9. We can learn from anywhere, anyone. 10. We should look at the best examples in any field to learn.
    - Note: 1. Yazmak, düşünmemize yardımcı olur. 2. Açık yazı, açık düşünmedir. 3. Herhangi bir konu hakkında bilgi edinebilirsiniz (ve gerçekten öğrenmelisiniz). 4. Herkes (sadece 'yazarlar' değil) yazar. 5. Taklit ederek öğreniriz. 6. Her konuya açık bir yazıyla erişilebilir. 7. Her alan, konu, alan... bir literatürü vardır. 8. İki tür yazı vardır: açıklayıcı ve açıklayıcı. 9. Her yerden, herkesten öğrenebiliriz. 10. Öğrenmek için herhangi bir alandaki en iyi örneklere bakmalıyız.
- “...writing is a form of thinking, whatever the subject.” (Loc 36)
- “But every discipline has a literature - a body of good writing that students and teachers can use as a model; writing is learned mainly by imitation.” (Loc 36)
- “Clear writing is the logical arrangement of thought; a scientist who thinks clearly can write as well as the best writer.” (Loc 46)
- “I thought of how often the act of writing even the simplest document - a letter, for instance - had clarified my half-formed ideas. Writing and thinking and learning were the same process.” (Loc 55)
- “Learning, he seemed to be saying, takes a multitude of forms; expect to find them in places where you least expect them to be.” (Loc 180)
- “Contrary to general belief, writing isn’t something that only “writers” do; writing is a basic skill for getting through life.” (Loc 188)
- “Writing is thinking on paper. Anyone who thinks clearly should be able to write clearly - about any subject at all.” (Loc 188)
- “Students should be learning a strong and unpretentious prose that will carry their thoughts about the world they live in.” (Loc 228)
- “...there’s no subject that can’t be made accessible in good English with careful writing and editing.” (Loc 429)
- “...a piece of writing is a piece of thinking.” (Loc 761)
- “If clear writing is one of the foundations of a democratic society, don’t count on getting it from men and women with a college degree.” (Loc 1033)
- “Writers and learners will write better and learn more if they understand the “why” of what they are studying.” (Loc 1267)
- “Nonfiction writing should always have a point: It should leave the reader with a set of facts, or an idea, or a point of view, that he didn’t have before he started reading.” (Loc 1959)
- “Writer’s who think they are being criticized when only their writing is being criticized are beyond a teacher’s reach.” (Loc 3035)
- “If writing is learned by imitation, I want every learner to imitate the best.” (Loc 3156)
- “Moral: think flexibly about the field you’re writing about. Its frontiers may no longer be where they were the last time you looked.” (Loc 3243)
- Such self-pity would have been despised by Mr. Spicer; emotions have no place in mathematics. He was one of those people who have “a head for figures,” instantly certain that twelve times nine is—well, whatever it is. Confronted with a student who was unable to produce the right answer, he would begin to turn red, a man betrayed by his vascular system, until his round face and bald head were crimson with disbelief that such dim-wittedness was at large in the next generation. (150)
- I never stopped to ask, “Who is the typical Yale alumnus? Who am I editing for?” One of my principles is that there is no typical anybody; every reader is different. I edit for myself and I write for myself. I assume that if I consider something interesting or funny, a certain number of other people will too. . . . Meanwhile I draw on two sources of energy that I commend to anyone trying to survive in this vulnerable craft: confidence and ego. If you don’t have confidence in what you’re doing you might as well not do it. (25)
- Whenever I embark on a story so overloaded with good material I despair of ever getting to the end—of covering the ground I know I’ll need to cover to tell the story right. In my gloom it helps me to remember two things. One is that writing is linear and sequential. If sentence B logically follows sentence A, and if sentence C logically follows sentence B, I’ll eventually get to sentence Z. I also try to remember that the reader should be given only as much information as he needs and not one word more. Anything else is a self-indulgence. (33–34)
- Achieving a decent piece of writing is such a difficult task that it often strikes the reader as having been just that: a task. It accomplishes its purpose, and perhaps we shouldn’t ask for anything more. But we do. We wish the writer had had a better time—or at least had given us that impression. . . . Writing is a craft, and a writer is someone who goes to work every day with his tools, like the carpenter or the television repairman, no matter how he feels, and if one of the things he wants to produce by 6 p.m. is a sense of enjoyment in his writing, he must generate it by an act of will. Nobody else is going to do it for him. (73, 75)
- "Writing about music also made me a better musician. The need to write clearly about an art form that the reader can never see or hear; one that evaporates with the playing of each note, forced me to think harder about the structure of music--about what I was trying to learn."
- 'it's not necessary to be a "writer" to write well. Clear writing is the logical arrangement of thought'
- 'writing and thinking and learning were the same process'
- P. 10 'I've become a clarity nut. I've also become a logic nut. I'm far less preoccupied than I once was with individual words and their picturesque roots and origins'
- P. 11 'writing is thinking on paper'
- P. 14 'writing is primarily an exercise in logic and that words are just tools designed to do a specific job'
- P. 21 'Generalists, as interested in astronomy and mathematics and evolution as they are in physics and the genetic code and the processes of life'
- 'we must say to students in every area of knowledge: "This is how other people have written about this subject. Read it, study it, think about it."'
- -Keep it simple -Writing is rethinking -To write clearly requires you to think clearly -Teaching kids to write in their field helps them become better at their field -Remove any background noise (bad formatting, wonky paragraphs, ramblings etc)
- "Writing is thinking on paper. Anyone who thinks clearly should be able to write clearly - about any subject at all."
- "The way to bein is with imitation. We all need models, whatever art or craft we're trying to learn." (p. 14)
- "The bad habits are just too habitual. They can be cured only by that most painful of surgical procedures: operating on what the writer has actually written. Only there, where a writer is at his most vulnerable, having put some part of himself on paper, does he make the connection between principle and practice." (p. 47)
