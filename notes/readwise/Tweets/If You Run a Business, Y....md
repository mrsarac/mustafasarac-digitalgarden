  Here is what you need to know: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510724587556868))
- 1/ Introduction
  There are a lot of MYTHS about how accounting works
  At its core, accounting is based on “Accrual Accounting”
  “Accrual Accounting” is a set of rules used to record business transactions ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510727389351938))
- In this thread I will:
  1 Explain what "Accrual Accounting" is
  2. Debunk common Accounting Myths ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510730224713728))
- 2/ Accrual Accounting
  Accrual Accounting is best understood through an example:
  Let’s say you’re the owner of a store that sells pencils:
  • You purchase 100 pencils for $1 each
  • You then sell 50 of those pencils for $3 each
  · What’s your profit? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510733122924544))
- There are a couple of ways to calculate profit:
  1. Using the “Cash Method” ➡️ how most people think accounting works
  2. Using the “Accrual Method” ➡️ the method accounting is based on
  Here is a chart:

- Notice how profit is completely different under the two methods?
  • It’s $50 under the CASH method
  • It’s $100 under the ACCRUAL method
  Why is profit different under Accrual Accounting? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510744850194438))
- The difference in the example above lies in how “Costs” are determined
  Cash Accounting:
  • You bought 100 pencils for $1, so you expense everything
  ➡️ Cost: 100 pencils * $1 = $100
  Accrual Accounting:
  • You only expense 50 pencils for $1
  ➡️ Cost: 50 pencils * $1 = $50 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510747782090752))
- This is because under Accrual Accounting you have to match:
  QUANTITY SOLD = QUANTITY EXPENSED ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510750655168513))
- 3/ Matching Principle
  Generally, under accrual accounting
  The QUANTITY in your COST must match the QUANTITY in your REVENUE
  Why?
  Because of the “Matching Principle” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510753465344005))
- MYTH: When you purchase goods, you can expense everything right away
  Accounting doesn’t work like that
  Instead, you only expense the portion of the goods you SOLD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510756313284614))
- In the above example, that’s 50 pencils NOT 100 pencils
  The remainder of the unsold pencils are capitalized and expensed ONLY when they are SOLD ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510759136063488))
- 4/ Inventory
  Because of the matching principle, there are consequences
  One of those consequences is the creation of INVENTORY balances ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510761979736064))
- Inventory is “goods” that you’ve paid for but haven’t sold yet
  These goods are capitalized on the balance sheet
  In our pencils example above, the inventory balance would be calculated as:

- 5/ Capitalizing Assets
  Closely related to the inventory example is the concept of Capitalizing Assets
  MYTH: When a business buys a new computer, you can write-off/expense it right away
  That’s not how accounting works ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510772440387589))
- Because you will use your computer for 2 to 3 years
  Accounting rules prevent you from expensing the computer when you buy it
  Instead, just like inventory – the computer is capitalized and slowly expensed over time ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510775317688320))
- Let’s look at an example:
  • You buy a computer for $1,500
  • You have to expense the computer over a certain period say, 3 years
  • In this case, can only expense $500 worth in the first year ($1,500 / 3 years)

- 6/ Accounts Receivable
  MYTH: You can only record a sale when cash is collected
  Accounting doesn’t work like that
  You have to record a sale when you invoice your customer ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510785170100233))
- If your customer takes 1 month to pay your bill, you DON’T wait 1 month to book the sale
  Instead, the sale is booked when the customer is invoiced
  You then record accounts receivable to show that the customer owes you money for the sale ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510788072583175))
- Let’s look at an example:
  • You sell a service to a customer for $100
  • You invoice the customer on December 31, 2021
  • The customer pays on January 31, 2022 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOSmFk0VkAIuHpF.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510794603077640))
- In the example above, For accrual Accounting: 
  The sale is booked in December 2021 when the customer was invoiced 
  NOT when payment was received ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510798566719493))
- 7/ Accounts Payable
  MYTH: You can only record an expense when you pay cash to your suppliers
  Accounting doesn’t work like that
  You have to record an expense when you receive a bill from a supplier ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510801439805443))
- If you take 1 month to pay the bill, you DON’T wait 1 month to book the expense
  Instead, the expense is booked when you get the bill from your supplier
  You then record ACCOUNTS PAYABLE to show that you owe money to your supplier ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510804367446021))
- Let’s look at an example:
  • You buy a service from a supplier for $500
  • Your supplier sends you a bill on February 28, 2022
  • You pay the bill on March 31, 2022 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOSmGgbVsAA59pa.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510810927259649))
- In the example above, for Accrual Accounting:
  The expense is booked on February 28, 2022 when you RECEIVED the bill 
  NOT when you PAID the bill ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510813968134152))
- 9/ Video Tutorial
  Here is a short video that explains how accrual accounting works:
  https://t.co/9ms7brWrjo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510816841306113))
- TL;DR:
  • You match revenues and expenses
  • You capitalize unsold goods as inventory
  • You capitalize assets
  • You record revenue when a sale is made not when cash is collected
  • You record expenses when you buy something not when you pay for it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliTheCFO/status/1505510819731288065))
