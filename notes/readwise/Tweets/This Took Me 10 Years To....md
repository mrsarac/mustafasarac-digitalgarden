- Excellence is a Habit
  You are what you continually do. 
  The Super Bowl is won in the preseason. 
  Your day begins the night before:
  • Curate your priorities before you go to bed
  • Wake up
  • Complete 3 big tasks
  • Go into nature
  • Come back and tackle more
  • Repeat

- Fall in Love With The Process
  There is no shortcut to success. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
  Enjoy the small wins:
  • You wrote a draft. Great work.
  • You sent a big email. Great work.
  • You closed a small deal. Great work.
  Success is about stacking tiny wins.

- Be Obsessed With Learning
  The most successful people are lifelong learners:
  • Learn from people on Twitter
  • Watch YouTube videos
  • Listen to podcasts
  “Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.”
