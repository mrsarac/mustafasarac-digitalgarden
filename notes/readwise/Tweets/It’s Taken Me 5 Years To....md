## Highlights
- Itâ€™s taken me 5 years to get to 3m subscribers on YouTube.
  Hereâ€™s 10 things Iâ€™ve learned along the way ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772385283969024))
- 1. Consistency matters
  In the early days on YouTube, nobody cares about your videos.
  Itâ€™s likely that youâ€™ll be the only person who watches all of the videos on your channel until the end. This isnâ€™t a bad thing, itâ€™s actually liberating. Film, hit publish and repeat. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772388748525569))
- 2. Gear doesnâ€™t matter at the start
  Do you have a phone? Is there something that youâ€™re passionate about?
  Nice - you can now write, record and edit a YouTube video. Itâ€™s really as simple as that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772391227428865))
- 3. Donâ€™t worry about the numbers
  It took me 52 videos over 6 months to get my first 1000 subscribers.
  Donâ€™t focus in on the data too much at the start. Just consistently make videos and let the data build up in YouTube Studio.

- 4. Stack the deck in your favour 
  â€˜Stacking the deckâ€™ means that youâ€™re doing all of the small actions you can to increase your chances of success. 
  Donâ€™t struggle to figure out everything alone- ask friends for feedback, get advice on your filming set-up, and work in public. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772401021083648))
- 5. Use your Unfair Advantages
  In the book The Unfair Advantage, authors @StartupHasan and @Ash_Ali share the hidden factors behind success.
  What makes you different? How can you capitalise on that? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772402946224128))
- @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali After posting consistently for months, I did a collaboration with @IbzMo about study tips that really helped my channel to start to grow. 
  Success on YouTube = Work x Luck x Your Unfair Advantage

- @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo 6. Focus on quantity over quality
  The more videos you make, and the more mistakes you make = the more you learn. Donâ€™t focus on being polished straight away - quality is developed over time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772407287468032))
- @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo To achieve quantity as you grow, you can begin to outsource certain tasks like finding a great video editor on @fiverr or levelling up your production quality with high-quality sound from @epidemicsound ðŸ˜ƒ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772409363644417))
- @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound 7. Donâ€™t worry about your niche 
  If you focus on making the things you enjoy, your niche will develop over time. Donâ€™t overthink it.

- @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound 8. Be patient and consistent 
  Success on YouTube doesnâ€™t happen overnight. Not even for @MrBeast or your favourite YouTuber.
  Youâ€™ll probably make no money for your first 50-100 videos, but you will improve at camera confidence, editing and scripting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772413452984320))
- @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound @MrBeast 9. Think about systems
  Create a system that works for you and stick to it. Itâ€™s a good idea to see what other YouTubers are doing for inspiration, but make sure you tweak it so that itâ€™s relevant to your situation.
  Capture your ideas, plan a publishing schedule and get moving. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772415491510272))
- @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound @MrBeast 10. Just publish
  With your phone or camera, press record and start uploading content.
  In my early days, I saved some of my best ideas until I had the beginning of an audience. I knew that I needed to focus on reps before expecting my videos to do anything. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772417588436992))
- @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound @MrBeast Donâ€™t procrastinate or overthink things.
  YouTube is fun - focus on the journey, not the destination. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal/status/1540772419761225728))
