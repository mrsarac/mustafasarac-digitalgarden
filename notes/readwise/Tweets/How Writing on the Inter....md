- 1. Writing makes you visible.
  Many people keep their ideas secret and get frustrated when opportunities don't come their way. They're fishing without bait. But writing in public keeps you in your readers' mind. When others see how you can help them, they reach out to you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1539717097932181504))
- 2. Your ideas go viral.
  Putting ideas on paper sharpens them because you develop simpler and catchier ways to communicate. It's hard for people to remember essays, but easy for them to remember taglines. The clearer your ideas become, the farther they'll spread. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1539717099093983240))
- 3. Writing is a people magnet.
  People spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars going to conferences and networking events. By writing, you can spark new connections from your couch. Sharing ideas on the Internet is like having a personal agent who works for you 24/7. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1539717100230549507))
- 4. Writing is an R&D lab for your brain.
  Your ideas become mushy if you don't write. Readers think that ideas take a clear and obvious path, while writers know all the dead ends they explored to reach their final destination.

- 5. Writing is a magnifying glass.
  It's a systematic way to examine the pillars of your thinking. When you zoom in, you see that might be wrong about things you thought you were 100% sure about. Sometimes, you learn that you know more about a topic than you realized. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1539718089285181442))
- 6. Writing is a compass.
  When you hoard ideas, it's hard to know how you can uniquely help others. But by sharing ideas online, you develop a unique point of view. You see the sides of yourself that others value the most, which becomes a compass for your professional life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1539718090338041857))
- 7. By writing, you define yourself.
  People are scared to commit to a topic. They don't focus because they're scared it'll curtail their intellectual freedom. But they forget that being known for something brings unexpected opportunities, which expand your intellectual life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1539718091315314693))
- 8. Writing leads to a Personal Monopoly.
  The goal of writing online is to be known for something valuable and unique. Most people think you can just show up and declare a niche. The more you write, the faster you'll discover your unique skillset.

- 9. Writing is synthesis.
  Read to collect the dots, write to connect them.
