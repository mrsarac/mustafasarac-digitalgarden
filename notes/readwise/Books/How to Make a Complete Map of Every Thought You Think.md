- You can put related concepts close to each other, REGARDLESS of the actual physical position of the pages. (Location 83)
- You can move things around. Trace paths of connection through. Make non-ordinal order apparent. All with Maps. (Location 84)
- So don’t keep a TOC, unless the material is intrinsically linear (a chronology, without episode tracking.) Keep a MOC! (Location 85)
- Speed lists are the answer to the demand. Speed lists are vast lists of simple thoughts- about 1-50 words. Generally around one line. (Location 94)
- There are two types of speed lists- pan-subject and subject. Pan-subject speed lists are for all thoughts, you take a pan-subj speed list out with you to work or to wherever you are going. Subject lists you keep in a cache notebook, and you have one per subject. You’d prefer to just use your subject lists, but sometimes you have to make do with a pan-subject speed list, and then transfer out from there to the individual speed lists. More on all of this later. (Location 95)
