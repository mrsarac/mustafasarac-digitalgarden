- Chapter 3 will take you through the physiology of what happens in your brain when the placebo effect is operating. You’ll read that, in one sense, the placebo works because you can embrace or entertain a new thought that you can be well, and then use it to replace the thought that you’ll always be sick. That means you can change your thinking from unconsciously predicting that your future is your same familiar past to beginning to anticipate and expect a new potential outcome. If you agree with this idea, then it means that you’ll have to examine how you think, what the mind is, and how these things affect the body.
