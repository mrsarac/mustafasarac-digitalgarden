Hello, I'm Mustafa Saraç. I'm a technology enthusiast, software developer, designer, and musician. I've been working in web design and development since 2000. I completed my master's degree in Information Technologies at Sabancı University.

Throughout my career, I've worked for leading media companies in Turkey. I conducted UX tests, designed web interfaces, and played an active role in bringing them to life. For a period, I led a frontend team of 5 people. Currently, I'm living in Cologne, Germany, and working as a front-end developer for the TOMRA Sorting Digital team.

Outside of work, I love being productive. I've been playing drums as an amateur for 15 years and have been learning to play the cajon for the past year. I'm actively involved in a music band, and we give small concerts.

I value personal development. I keep a daily journal, enjoy reading books, and like to research time management. I have a special interest in Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and conduct experimental work in this area. I even developed and published my own note-taking application called Phinote for a short time.

I enjoy sharing my ideas. I write articles on my personal blog at irregular intervals and create content on my YouTube channel. Additionally, I share my discoveries related to my areas of interest through a weekly email newsletter.

I love cycling, walking, and thinking while walking. I've noticed that during these activities, my mind opens up and I generate creative ideas. I use talking to myself as an effective method for solving problems.

My wife Ayşegül, my son Jerfi, and I have been living in Cologne since 2020. This new life experience has given me the opportunity to encounter different cultures and ways of working.

I have a tendency to think quickly and respond promptly, which can sometimes be a weakness. However, my determination to finish a task once I set my mind to it is one of my favorite qualities.

I always enjoy sharing my experiences in technology, design, music, and personal development, and learning new things. If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can reach me through my social media accounts or via email.
